### Coding Challenge Guidelines
Dialogue is Canada's leading health and wellness provider, serving over 50,000 companies and organizations. Dialogue's core programs are the Primary Care, Mental Health+ and EAP programs. As part of our offering, and a key differentiator in the market, we provide customers reporting on engagement, satisfaction and outcome. As a member of the Data Analytics team, you are responsible for the quality, content and availability of these reports. 

A member of the Customer Success team, Laura, approaches you after receiving a customer request. This specific customer, Dunder Miflin (Organization ID = 4), suspects a spike in utilization of Dialogue services over the full year of 2023, after receiving overwhelming positive feedback from employees. Laura would like to understand whether there has indeed been an increase in utilization, and determine the root cause. An increase in utilization is great, as it indicates members are getting access to care. However, this may have a negative impact on this account's financials. Being a service provider, Dialogue's costs of goods sold (COGs) are measured exclusively through costs to serve. Cost to serve is based on the cost to serve one episode, and is split by program. Utilization rate is based on the number of episodes opened and the average number of eligible members, within a given period. 

You will find attached three CSV files, which you will need in order to perform this analysis. Each CSV file represents the output of a data model compiled and stored in Dialogue's warehoues. The data presented is restricted to the full year 2023. No additional data point is required for this analysis. 

You are tasked with analyzing this customer's utilization and financial profile, in order to equip Laura with the information she needs to support her client. Please prepare a full analysis of this customer, documenting your data exploration and presenting the results as if presenting to a customer. You are expected to highlight trends in utilization, and potential root causes for these changes. You should also provide Laura with a gross margin profile for this account, based on the 2023 actual costs and revenue, as well as projections for 2024. Please attach a copy of any SQL query used in this process, as well as the output.
